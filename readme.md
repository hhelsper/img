## Description

IMG is a website for buying and selling NFT's. Users can signup as either creators or customers and then sign in to their account where as a creator, you can upload pictures to sell, naming them and setting a price. As a customer type user, you can browse the gallery where you can see all NTF's currently for sale along with their names, the creator name, and the associated price. Each customer starts with an account balance of $100, which will change based on their purchases while using the site. Sales of images on the creator side will be reflected in their accounts which will display current balance based on all images sold as well as how many images they have uploaded for sale. Finally users can log out of the app when finishing using it. 


## Tech Used

This website was created using flask python backend, html, css and bootstrap for front end and a postgresql database. My database has 8 tables and 5 foreign keys.
